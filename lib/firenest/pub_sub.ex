defmodule Firenest.PubSub do
  @moduledoc """
  A distributed pubsub implementation.

  The PubSub implementation runs on top of a `Firenest.Topology`
  and uses Elixir's `Registry` to provide a scalable dispatch
  implementation.

  ## Example

  PubSub is typically set up as part of your supervision tree
  alongside the desired topology:

      children = [
        {Firenest.Topology, name: MyApp.Topology, adapter: Firenest.Topology.Erlang},
        {Firenest.PubSub, name: MyApp.PubSub, topology: MyApp.Topology}
      ]

  Once the topology and pubsub processes are started, processes
  may subscribe, unsubscribe and broadcast messages:

      # Subscribe the current process to a given topic
      Firenest.PubSub.subscribe(MyApp.PubSub, "lobby:messages")

      # Broadcasts a message
      Firenest.PubSub.broadcast(MyApp.PubSub, "lobby:messages", "hello world")

  PubSub will always broadcast to all nodes in the topology,
  even if they are not running the PubSub service. In case you
  want to broadcast to a subset of your topology, consider creating
  multiple topologies.

  Starts a pubsub with the given `options`.

  The `:name` and `:topology` keys are required as part of `options`.
  `:name` refers to the name of the pubsub to be started and `:topology`
  must point to a topology started by `Firenest.Topology`.
  The remaining options are described below.

  ## Options

    * `:name` - the name of the pubsub to be started
    * `:topology` - the name of a `Firenest.Topology` that powers
      the distribution mechanism
    * `:partitions` - the number of partitions under the pubsub system.
      Partitioning provides vertical scalability on machines with multiple
      cores, allowing subscriptions and broadcasts to happen concurrently.
      By default uses one partition for every 4 cores.
    * `:dispatcher` - a module and function tuple that is called every time
      there is a broadcast and must perform local message deliveries. It
      receives the subscriptions entries, the broadcaster identifier and the
      message to broadcast

  ## The dispatching value

  An optional `value` may be given which may be used by custom
  dispatchers (see `start_link/1`). For instance, Phoenix Channels
  use a custom `value` to provide "fastlaning", allowing messages
  broadcast to thousands or even millions of users to be encoded
  once and written directly to sockets instead of being encoded per
  channel.

  Unless you are implementing custom dispatching rules, you can
  safely ignore the `value` argument.
